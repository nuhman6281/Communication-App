## Verify It's Working

Try the AI features in your chat app:

You should get responses within 1-2 seconds!

## Free Tier Limits

- **Requests per day**: 14,400
- **Requests per minute**: 30
- **Tokens per minute**: 20,000

This is MORE than enough for development and testing!

## Switching Back to OpenAI Later

When you're ready to use OpenAI (requires paid account):

1. Open `.env` file
2. Change: `AI_PROVIDER=groq` to `AI_PROVIDER=openai`
3. Uncomment the OpenAI API key line
4. Add credits to your OpenAI account

That's it! The code supports both providers.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Groq API key not configured"
- Make sure you added your key to `.env`
- Check for typos
- Restart the backend server

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
- You've hit the free tier limit (30 requests/minute)
- Wait a minute and try again
- Or upgrade to Groq paid tier for higher limits

### Slow responses?
- Groq is usually FASTER than OpenAI (< 1 second)
- If slow, check your internet connection
- Groq servers might be under load (rare)
